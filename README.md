Project Descritpion: Designed, synthesized and verified the source code in UVM environment. 
The test cases included different size payload, FIFO full condition, the packet which is never read, corrupt packet, 
simultaneous read and write operation.

The code was written in Verilog. Simulation and synthesis were carried out in Xilinx ISE. Verification was carried out in UVM environment.
